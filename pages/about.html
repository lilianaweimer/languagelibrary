        <p>Welcome to the Language Library! This project intends to collect and
          organize resources for language learning and learning about language.
        </p>
        <p>Through my own journey to try to teach myself languages or find ways
          to learn, I have found that there are few centralized places to look
          for resources that aren't on websites like Reddit, where posts might
          get deleted or that have poor search functionality. Because of this, I
          wanted to create a place where people interested in learning languages
          can find good starting places without having to spend lots of time
          digging through search results themnselves.</p>
        <p>I feel it goes without saying, but I should be clear that it's just
          one person maintaining this site, so there may be broken links,
          outdated resources, or missing resources. If you find a broken link, a
          bug, or know of any good resources I don't have listed, please let me
          know!</p>
        <p>I am starting this project with just a few languages to get a feel
          for building up the resources pages, and will try to continue to add
          new resources and languages whenever I have time! </p>
        <p>Happy learning!</p>
