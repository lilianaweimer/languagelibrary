# Language Library

A simple, HTML & CSS only project made to fill the need: why is there no one place to go to find links to resources for learning languages and learning about languages?

This is a massive undertaking, clearly, so I don't expect work on it is going to go very fast.

For the time being, deployed to [GithubPages](https://lilianaweimer.github.io/languagelibrary/).

Once it's complete I plan to migrate it to Neocities.
